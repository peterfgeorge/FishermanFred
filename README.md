# FishermanFred

Idea: game where you’re a little pixel art fisherman and you pull up enemies from the pond and then have to fight them in order to catch them, it’s kind of like pokemon where you have a book and you try to catch them all.

You can upgrade your fishing line to throw farther/deeper into the water to collect new enemies

Kind of like a roguelike where if you die you lose your items and equipment but you don’t lose progress on the enemies you’ve caught.

Essentially there’s certain items/types of bait you need to catch certain enemies, and theres only certain enemies you can catch from regular bait (worms). So it’s kinda like a tree with the base being what enemies you can catch with just a worm and then when you beat those certain enemies you get bait that you can then catch different more difficult enemies from there.

Fishing mechanics: I think there will be a fishing book where you can learn about the enemies and where they live in the lake, so some will live in shallower water, some will live in deeper water. You start where you’re just on the side of the lake on a bank and then after a certain amount of money you can get a boat which lets you go to the middle of the lake with a fishing boat and new enemies that don't live near the edges of the lake will be able to be caught there. You can also buy fishing rods that are stronger, so fish don’t get away as easily (bigger fish will be stronger and are more likely to get away, smaller fish are less likely). You can also buy longer line which lets you fish deeper. (this should go somewhere else, but there will be a simple menu in which you can choose your rod, line, and bait easily, kind of like the mario kart menu before you start a race where you build your kart, making it as intuitive as possible. 
You choose how far to cast the rod, and the farther you go the deeper itll b essentially, might let you control the exact location too.
When a fish gets on the hook there will b a variable amount of time in a time window depending on the fish that you need to start reeling (some fish have a shorter window than others)
Then it will be a combo of button mashing and balance where you spam left, right and up, and left and right make sure your character doesn’t lose balance and fall over as he will tilt back and forth and then you need to also constantly raise the enemy up to get them out of the water
As you pull up fish, each button you push will play a note like when you hit a tree in Fortnite except it will play a shortened version of the tune that you will fight that pecific fish to

When you get a fishing boat you can customize it which will customize the arena.

Also the location of the spot on the side of the lake where you are customizes the arena

(maybe also add weather in the game where certain fish are easier to catch or can only be caught when it’s raining or during night/whatever)

Arena - arenas are different depending on which location you’re in, if you’re next to a stream you could be platforming to fight the monster on different logs and stuff. There will also be a regular flat ground arena. Some arenas will have trees that drop things during the fight. One monster will definitely drag you under the water and you have to fight it under water. Fishing boats could rock side to side and have platforms based on the design of the ship.


Cobat: You will have a sword and also can use your fishing rod as a weapon. You will have a dodge roll. Maybe the fishing rod will also be a sword


Enemies:
Frog
It sticks out its tongue and you need to jump up and stab it, or hook it once it sticks its tongue out to get you and pull. When you get a critical hit from hooking an enemies eye or tongue it will flash white instead of red or something.
Giant worm
Kind of like a mother worm that you pull up by surprise (it wants revenge for all the little worms you use as bait lol)
One of the moves it does is move back and forth across the screen and you have to run under the worm as it essentially does the wave.
Swordfish
Has legs and runs around and sword fights you
Pufferfish
Bounces around and you have to run under it
Shoots poison darts sometimes
Every time you pop it it flies around the screen and you gotta dodge it
Boot
It looks like a boot so at first you think it’s a dud and you haven't caught anything, but theres actually an algae seaweed monster and it wears the boot as a hat and crawls around and tries to stomp you by going on its head (which is the boot lol) and can the hop from there to somewhere else. You need to try and hook the boot and pull it fully off, then you can damage the monster because it has no armor. Every time you hook it, the boot gets visibly a little more loosened.
Octopus
Has a bunch of swords or knives in it’s hands (or honestly maybe it doesn’t) but you need to dodge the hands and cut them off one by one and the movement patterns change every few hands
Flying fish
There's actually two of them, you pull one and the other follows bc they’re best friends or something.
They fly around and do dual attacks where for example one could swoop high while one swoops low, so you gotta jump but not too high kind of to thread the needle.



Small Fry
Tutorial enemy
Kind of just flops around lol but you don't want to get too close to it, just teaches you the basics of the attacks and the dodges and movement (will flop around in different ways to teach you everything)
Cat fish
Haha it’s a cat but also a fish so it can leap around but meows and has fins
Sun fish
It shoots bright rays of the sun at players and the rays/beams move around and you have to dodge them
School of fish
Not sure the best way to do this one yet but maybe a schoolfish teacher and then the kids follow it around?
Also could use it as a “tree” evolution where you first catch the elementary school fish, then middle, then highschool and they get bigger and more difficult as they go on, then you get to the teacher fish and then the principal which is the final boss fish… maybe, still don’t know if that’s the right way to go.
Sailfish
The fastest fish in the ocean, literally, I looked it up. It’ll speed around requiring fast reaction time.
Wahoo
Would be fun bc UVA lol
Anglerfish
Found at the bottom of the ocean so you’ll need the longest fishing line to catch
Has the light on its head, I think if you get too close or it blinks at a certain time you’ll be blinded like a flash bang from an fps and that’s when the fish will attack you.
Clownfish
Does acrobatics blah blah, its funny too cuz it’s a clown
Shark
Idk what kinda shark but would b cool
